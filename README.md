# Insurance Cost Analysis and Prediction

##  Overview
This project analyzes health insurance data to understand the factors that affect medical insurance charges and to build a model that predicts insurance cost.

##  Dataset
The dataset contains information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

##  Steps Followed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and insurance cost
3. Visualized trends using graphs and plots
4. Built regression models to predict insurance charges
5. Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics

##  Results
The analysis showed that smoking status and BMI are major factors influencing insurance cost.

##  How to Run
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially.
